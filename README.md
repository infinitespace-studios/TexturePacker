# TexturePacker
A MonoGame Pipeline Extension for TexturePacker xml files

Based partially on the work done at https://github.com/RandolphBurt/TexturePacker-MonoGameLoader

This tool does not parse the data at runtime, it provides a MonoGame Content Pipleine Extension which will
transform the data from raw .xml and .png files to optimized .xnb files for the target platform. 

NOTE at the moment only generic xml is supported. Future Importers will be implemented.
